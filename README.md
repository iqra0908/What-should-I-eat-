# What should I eat?

![](data/recipe-book.jpg)

This is a big question of the day usually. I always struggly with what to cook for my next meal that doesn't require me to go the the grocery store again. After endless browsing on internet, I usually end up with something simple, unhealthy, or ordering takeout.

To tackle this problem, this project will provide recipes for the ingredients we already have in the kitchen.
